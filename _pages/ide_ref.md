## Load File  
Directly load data from text file from `File > Open File`. For 3D data select the required `X/Y` value from the provied slider or scrolling inside the plot. If you want to add multiple data set from other files, you can load them through `File > Add File`. You can use the recent files menu to quickly load any of the last recent 10 files.

## 3D Viewer  
For easy editing 3D data files, a 2D projection for a particular `X/Y` value. To view the complete 3D plot open the 3D viewer window through the `Window > 3D Plot Viewer`. The viewer updates in real time as you make updates in the main window.

## Edit data  
This software features different data editing options, available to use thourgh keyboard shortcuts and also through the right click context menu  
### Drag with mouse  
Move any data points just dragging it mouse. By defualt data points is movable only in vertical direction (i.e. y-axis). Check the `Edit > Points movable horaizontally` to move them in x-axis too. To drag multiple data points simultaneously and drag any of them.

### Drag with keyboard  
Select the required data points and move them using navigation on keyboard. This option is available only for mooving in y-axis

### Smooth with spline
Select data points that you want to smooth and press `D`. The data points will be replaced with a smoothing spline approximation  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

### Smooth with mooving average
Press `M` after selecting data points to apply an moving average over them.
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")


### Smooth with regression
Replace data points with a quadratic regressing approximation by pressing `E`
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")


### Smoothing multiple datasets simultaneously  
At any moment all data editing feature is only available for a single dataset. But the primary dataset for edit can be quickly toggled through the `Plot utility` button or by pressing `Ctrl+TAB`

### Set required value  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

### Remove bad data points  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Interpolate data 
Use interpolation to fill missing grid values or make the grid denser or vice-versa through `Edit > Fill values`  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Extend Data
Extend your dataset by repeating or mirroring. This can be applied globally  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

or locally  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Data fitting  
(Only) 2D data set can be fitted thorugh two types of fitting  
### Polynomial regressing fitting  
Use `Fitting > Polynomial Regression fitting`
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

### Lavenberg-Marqardett fitting  
Use `Fitting > Lavenberg-Marqardett fitting`


## Swap data
To swap data values between two data sets open swapper mode by `View > Toggle Swapper`  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## UnDo ReDo
You can undo or redo last 10 changes by pressing `Ctrl+Z` or `ShiftCtrl+Z`  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Plot settings
To make any changes to the plot option/style like marker/line styles, font styles, open the setting window `View > Open Plot Settings`  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Export as image
Save your plot in different format and resolution. Use `File > Export as image` or the camera sign on the plot corner  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Work with spreadsheet  
Open a spreadsheet containing the current data set through `Window > Spreadsheet`. You can directly make changes to the data set  
![alt text](gifs/screenshot.gif "Screen shot")

## Work with the 3D Plotter  
A 3D plotter is also provided to quickly plot 3D data sets

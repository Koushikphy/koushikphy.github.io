## Setting up WSL
### Step 1. Activate WSL
WSL is not active by default in Windows 10. To activate search for `Turn Windows features on or off` in windows search bar and check `Windows Subsystem for Linux`.

Now, restart your system.

### Step 2. Installing Linux:
Go to Microsoft store and search for `linux` and select `Run Linux on Windows` or just go to this link https://aka.ms/wslstore. Now install a linux distro of your choice (e.g. ubuntu).

After store finishes installing search and open `Bash` from windows search bar. First time you open, it will set up linux on your system and asks you to provide a new username and password for WSL. Now ypu are done with installing linux in windows and open up the bash terminal by searching from windows search bar. You can install these registry files to shortcut to the contextmenu to quickly open bash anywhere


## SSH setup:
1. Install `OpenSSH server` ,
    ```
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    ```

2. Open `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and edit these two lines 
    ```bash
    PasswordAuthentication no
    X11Forwarding no
    ```
    to this
    ```
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    X11Forwarding yes
    ```
    The first one is to allow ssh login from other computer with password and the second is to forward X11 server through ssh, so that X11 GUI window (like gnuplot, gedoit) can be opened.
3. Restart the ssh server,
    ```
    sudo service ssh restart
    ```
    Now the SSH server is up and running and you can log in to the WSL from any computer on the same network.

## Setting up X server
By defualt you can just use the bash terminal to do everything on WSL and can't open any GUI. But linux systems can communicate through a X server to display graphical user interface and receive inuput from user. But windows doesn't have any X server by default so to open GUI directly from WSL we need to install an X server application on windows. Popular choices are `vcXser` or `Xming`. Download and install any of them. Now launch the `X Launch` from desktop and you will see the port where X server is running on the system tray

For my case its `:0.0`. Now forward the WSL display to this port 
```
export DISPLAY=:0.0
```
and you will be able to open Linux GUI from WSL bash terminal.
